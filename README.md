# bamazon
Command line mock inventory management system

# Overview
This application uses node and mySql as well as the inquirer NPM package to view items in a database, and make changes based on user input. 

# Instruction
The bamazon app is run with the following command line: 
> node bamazonCustomer

When run, a table with the available items will be displayed, and then the user will be prompted with:
* the item_id of the item that they want to purchase
* the quanity of the item they would like to purchase

The program will then check that there is enough items available, and then display the total price of all items and then update the database to 
reflect the items sold. If not enough are available, the user will get a message saying "not enough inventory" and then be prompted to pick another item.
